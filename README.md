# Habit Traker App

A small React Native Project I built to explore mobile development.

This app is a habit tracker that lets users create, edit and track their habit daily / weekly / monthly habits.

It is based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50gwzwLvAk) I followed but I had to adapt many parts because several librairies had changed since the video was published.

That made it a great opportunity to debug, adapt and learn React Native in depth.

## Tech Stack

- React Native (with Expo)
- Expo router
- Appwrite (for backend and database)
- React native paper
- React native gesture handler

## App features

1. **Today's Habits**

- Display all habits created by the logged-in user.
- Habits can be daily, weekly, monthly.
- Swipe right to mark habit as completed.
- Swipe left to delete a habit.

2. **Streaks**

- Displays overall progress and frequency of completed habits.
- Show off Top 3 of the habits that are most consistently followed.

3. **Add Habit**

- Lets the user create new habits.

## What I learned

During this process I had to adapt multiple parts of the code because the librairies had evolved since the tutorial's release.

- Appwrite switched from Databases to TablesDB.
- API rate limits required to locally run Appwrite.
- Protected Routes logic in Expo Router changed and I had to use Stack layouts for protected routes instead of manually setting a RouteGuard.
- React native gesture handler replaced Swipeable with ReanimatedSwipeable.

Each issus pushed me to read documentation deeply and truly understand how each library works, rather than just copying the tutorial.

## What's next?

This project confirmed my interest in investigating React Native further and I'm already planning my next personal app to keep learning and experimenting.

## Get started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Appwrite Account](https://appwrite.io/)

### Clone project and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohmerpauline/react-native-habit-tracker.git
yarn install
```

### Configure Appwrite and create database / tables

If you want to try the app locally, youâ€™ll need to recreate the database and tables in Appwrite. Below is the exact schema you need.

1. Install and run Appwrite locally with Docker

[Follow the instructions from the documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop-locally)

2. Create a new project in Appwrite

3. Add platforms

- In the project overview, add iOS and Android platforms.
- This will allow the React Native app to connect to Appwrite.

4. Create database (e.g. habits-db)

5. Create tables

#### Table 1: habits

| Field Name       | Type   | Required | Max Length / Constraints | Default |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| `user_id`        | string | yes      | 1000                     |         |
| `title`          | string | yes      | 1000                     |         |
| `description`    | string | yes      | 1000                     |         |
| `frequency`      | string | no       | 1000                     | daily   |
| `streak_count`   | number | yes      | min: 0                   |         |
| `last_completed` | string | yes      | 1000                     |         |

- **$id field** is generated automatically when creating the table.
- **Permissions** (Settings > Permissions > All users): Create, Read, Update, Delete

#### Table 2: habit-completions

| Field Name     | Type   | Required | Max Length |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| `habit_id`     | string | yes      | 1000       |
| `user_id`      | string | yes      | 1000       |
| `completed_at` | string | yes      | 1000       |

- **$id field** is generated automatically when creating the table.
- **Permissions** (Settings > Permissions > All users): Create, Read

6. Create file .env.local

- Fill the file with keys from Appwrite by following the model from .env.example

### Run the app

```bash
npx expo start
```
